## Troubleshooting

* **Port 8080 already in use**
  Change the port in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

  ```properties
  server.port=8081
  ```

* **Missing dependencies**
  Run the following command:

  ```bash
  mvn clean install
  ```

* **Lombok not working in IntelliJ**

    1. Install the Lombok plugin:
       `File > Settings > Plugins > Marketplace > Search for 'Lombok'`
    2. Enable annotation processing:
       `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors > Enable`
